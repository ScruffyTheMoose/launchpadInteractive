`launchpadInteractive` is an art project where I attempted to turn positional and elevation data pulled from the US National Geographic Survey API into interesting and interactive visuals intended for use with the Launchpad Mini MIDI controller.

### How do you interact with it?
Enter some US based latitude/longitude coordinates and press submit OR just use your current location!
Once the grid populates on your screen just start mashing buttons and watch unusual and colorful patterns generate on both your Launchpad and the screen!
